# Constraints

One of the greatest benefits of the relational model is the ability to define data integrity as part of the model. Data integrity is achieved through rules called constraints that are defined in the data model and enforced by the RDBMS.

## What is a KEY in SQL?
A KEY in SQL is a value used to identify records in a table uniquely. An SQL KEY is a single column or combination of multiple columns used to uniquely identify rows or tuples in the table. SQL Key is used to identify duplicate information, and it also helps establish a relationship between multiple tables in the database.

Note: Columns in a table that are NOT used to identify a record uniquely are called non-key columns.

## What is a Primary Key?

A primary is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely.

It has following attributes

* A primary key cannot be NULL
* A primary key value must be unique
* The primary key values should rarely be changed
* The primary key must be given a value when a new record is inserted.

## What is foreign key?

Foreign Key references the primary key of another Table! It helps connect your Tables

* A foreign key can have a different name from its primary key
* It ensures rows in one table have corresponding rows in another
* Unlike the Primary key, they do not have to be unique. Most often they arenâ€™t
* Foreign keys can be null even though primary keys can not
