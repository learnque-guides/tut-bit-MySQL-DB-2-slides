# Missing value

* Two-valued predicate logic, a predicate is either true or false. If a predicate is not true, it must be false. 
* Three-valued predicate logic refers to the three possible logical values that can result from a predicate—true, false, and unknown.

SQL implements three-valued predicate logic by supporting the NULL marker to signify the generic concept of a missing value.
