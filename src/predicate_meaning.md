# Predicate meaning

* A predicate is a property or an expression that either holds or doesn’t hold—in other words, is either true or false. The relational model relies on predicates to maintain the logical integrity of the data and define its structure. The predicate is “salary greater than zero” (SQL expression: salary > 0)
* You can also use predicates when filtering data to define subsets, and more. For example, if you need to query the Employees table and return only rows for employees from the sales department, you use the predicate “department equals sales” in your query filter
* In set theory, you can use predicates to define sets. 

As an example of a finite set defined with a predicate, the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} can be defined as the set of all elements for which the following predicate holds true: “x is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and smaller than or equal to 9.”
