# SQL meaning

* In order to interact with a relational database we can use the SQL (Structured Query Language) language.
* SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a standard language that was designed to query and manage data in relational database management systems (RDBMSs). 
* An RDBMS is a database management system based on the relational model (a semantic model for representing data), which in turn is based on two mathematical branches: set theory and predicate logic.
* SQL is both an ANSI and ISO standard language based on the relational model, designed for querying and managing data in an RDBMS.
* The following standards have been released: SQL-86 (1986), SQL-89 (1989), SQL-92 (1992), SQL:1999 (1999), SQL:2003 (2003), SQL:2006 (2006), SQL:2008 (2008), and SQL:2011 (2011).
* SQL uses a declarative one. That is, SQL requires you to specify what you want to get and not how to get it, letting the RDBMS figure out the physical mechanics required to process your request.
